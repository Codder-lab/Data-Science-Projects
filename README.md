# Repository Name: Data-Science-Projects

**Description**  

Welcome to the **Data-Science-Projects** repository! This repository contains a curated set of diverse data science projects, each designed to demonstrate and practice various data science techniques, tools, and methodologies.

**Projects Included**
1. Zomato Data Analysis Using Python

    Description:  

    To address our analysis, we need to respond to the subsequent inquiries:
    
      1. Do a greater number of restaurants provide online delivery as opposed to offline services?
      2. Which types of restaurants are the most favored by the general public?
      3. What price range is preferred by couples for their dinner at restaurants?

    Tools:  
  
    **Numpy**, **Pandas**, **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn**  

3. Loan Approval Prediction Using Machine Learning

    Description:  

    When it comes to deciding whether the applicant’s profile is relevant to be granted with loan or not, Banks have to look after many aspects.

    So, here we will be using Machine Learning with Python to ease their work and predict whether the candidate’s profile is relevant or not using key features like Marital     Status, Education, Applicant Income, Credit History, etc.  

    Tools:  

    **Pandas**, **Numpy**, **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn**, **Sklearn**, 

**Getting Started**  

To get started with any of these projects, simply clone the repository and navigate to the respective project directory:  
```
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/data-science-projects-collection.git  
cd data-science-projects-collection/Project_1
```

**Installation**  

Each project directory contains a README.md file with detailed instructions on how to set up and run the project. Most projects require Python 3.x and the relevant libraries listed in requirements.txt which can be installed using:  
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**Contributions**  

Contributions are welcome! If you have a data science project that you would like to add to this collection, please submit a pull request. Ensure that your project includes a clear README.md file with instructions and descriptions.
