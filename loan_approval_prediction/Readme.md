# **Loan Approval Prediction Using Machine Learning**  

**Project Description**  
This project aims to predict loan approvals using various machine learning models. The objective is to develop a model that can accurately classify whether a loan application will be approved based on the applicant's information.  

**Key Features**  
**-Data preparation:** Loading Data, Handling Missing Values, Encoding Categorical Variables, Visualize through graph.  
**-Model Training:** Several machine learning models were trained and evaluated - Random Forest Classifier, K-Nearest Neighbors, Support Vector Classifier, Logistic Regression.  
**-Model evaluation:** The models were evaluated based on their accuracy on both the training and testing sets. The Random Forest Classifier achieved the highest accuracy.  

**Technologies Used**  
1. Python
2. Pandas
3. Numpy
4. Matplotlib
5. Seaborn
6. Scikit-learn  

**Dataset**  
The dataset used for this analysis is LoanApprovalPrediction.csv, which include features like Loan ID, Education, Applicant Income, Loan Amount, and more.
